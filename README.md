This repository was created by Joanna Leng while working for the Advanced Research Computing at the University of Leeds in January 2018.

This repository uses a bash script and python code to create html tables that display the modules that ate available on the various hpc systems. These html files can be integrated into a wordpress website and can be automatically generated on the hpc systems as cron jobs.
